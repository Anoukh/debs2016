# [DEBS Grand Challenge 2016](http://www.ics.uci.edu/~debs2016/call-grand-challenge.html)
**The 10th ACM International Conference on Distributed and Event-Based Systems, Irvine, CA, June 20 - June 24, 2016**

The ACM DEBS 2016 Grand Challenge is the sixth in a series of challenges which seek to provide a common ground and uniform evaluation criteria for a competition aimed at both research and industrial event-based systems. The goal of the 2016 DEBS Grand Challenge competition is to evaluate event-based systems for real-time analytics over high volume data streams in the context of graph models.

The underlying scenario addresses the analysis metrics for a dynamic (evolving) social-network graph. Specifically, the 2016 Grand Challenge targets following problems: 
(1) identification of the posts that currently trigger the most activity in the social network, and 
(2) identification of large communities that are currently involved in a topic. The corresponding queries require continuous analysis of a dynamic graph under the consideration of multiple streams that reflect updates to the graph.

This repository contains the solution developed by Wso2 for the grand challenge.It has two folders containing solution implemented using Siddhi named "SiddhiVersion" and the solution implemented without using Siddhi as "NonSiddhiVersion"
